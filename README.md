Save trees by writing your documentation in Markdown and then transforming it into HTML!

### What is a "sugi"?

>It is endemic to Japan, where it is known as sugi (Japanese: Êùâ). The tree is called Japanese cedar[3] or Japanese red-cedar[4] in English.

**Note:** Sugi is currently in alpha, so many features have not been implemented yet. This
document serves as a roadmap. Feel free to request features by submitting an issue.
Thank you for your understanding.

## Installation
To install Sugi, all you need to do is run:

```
npm install sugi -g
```

## Usage
Find the markdown file that you would like to transform, for example:
```
sugi documentation.md
```
Your new file will be called `documentation.html`.

However, if you specify the name in the command like so:
```
sugi documentation.md index.html
```
Then you will get `index.html`

## Options
```
sugi --version
```
Outputs the currently installed version.

## Update
To update sugi:
```
npm update sugi -g
```

## Issues

request.
